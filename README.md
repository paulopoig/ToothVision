<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project was developed as a course requirement for "Application Development" with the goal of creating a useful application that addresses a real-world issue. PLM-VVM (Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila - Virtual Voting Machine) was conceived to tackle problems faced by our university in conducting Supreme Student Elections using online forms.

The purpose of this project is to provide a faster voting solution for PLM's student elections. Implementing a Virtual Voting Machine (VVM) can help prevent common errors, reduce fraud, and expedite vote counting.

PLM-VVM follows Create, Read, Update, and Delete principles as a framework for voting scenarios. It was further improved by adding an authentication system that restricts voting to only Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila students.
