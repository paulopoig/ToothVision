<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/189557711/ToothVision"><img src="https://github.com/paulopoig/ToothVision/assets/78188625/795c3c4e-6147-48f1-ac82-34233f4ea723" alt="ToothVision Mobile Application Showcase"></a>

ToothVision was developed for my System Integration and Architecture pre-thesis course, which focused on leveraging modern technologies like artificial intelligence to create practical solutions for real-world problems. Our team aimed to employ AI algorithms and models to streamline a process or assist a field where technology could provide demonstrable benefits.

After extensive research, we decided to create a system to aid dental patients struggling to interpret complex radiography scans. To address this, ToothVision uses computer vision technology integrated via the camera to examine panoramic x-rays - the scan type providing the most comprehensive dental view. The application detects potential conditions and displays them directly on an interactive 3D model using augmented reality markers color-coded by issue severity (e.g. healthy, decayed).

The goal of ToothVision is to equip patients with understandable information about their dental state using AI-powered predictive analytics. An interactive 3D model shows patients' own teeth with superimposed markers indicating predicted conditions and suggested treatments, as corroborated by licensed dentists. Critically, ToothVision serves only as a guide to supplement clinician expertise - not to replace dentists outright.

1. Image Capture and Upload:

* Allow users to capture dental radiography images directly through the mobile app.
* Provide the option to upload existing radiography images from the device.
  
2. Computer Vision Algorithms:

* Implement advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze dental radiography images.
* Detect common dental conditions, such as cavities, fractures, and periodontal issues.

3. Teeth Segmentation:

* Segment individual teeth on the radiography for precise analysis.
* Differentiate between healthy and affected areas.

4. Condition Detection:

* Identify and classify various dental conditions using the computer vision model.
* Provide a detailed analysis of each condition detected.

### Augmented Reality (AR) Model:
1. Interactive 3D AR Model:

* Integrate an interactive 3D AR model of teeth for a more immersive user experience.
* Allow users to rotate, zoom, and interact with the 3D model.

2. Real-time Condition Visualization:

* Overlay detected dental conditions on the AR model in real-time.
* Use color-coded indicators or overlays to highlight affected areas.

3. Treatment Summaries:

* On click or interaction with specific areas in the AR model, display summarized information about the detected condition.
* Provide suggested treatments and relevant details.

### 2D Illustrations:
1. Interactive 2D Illustrations:

* Include interactive 2D illustrations for users who prefer a simpler interface.
* Maintain consistency with the AR model in terms of functionality.

2. Real-time Visualization:

If you have any questions about this project or would like to use this framework for your own use case, please feel free to contact me at:
Paulo Danque - paulobrave17@gmail.com

I'm happy to provide more details on the implementation, assist with adapting it to your needs, or discuss any other aspects of PLM-VVM. Your feedback is also welcome as it will help strengthen and extend this mobile application to best serve dental patients across various places in the Philippines.

A quick note: certain essential assets, including the training model and specific frameworks for ToothVision, are currently unavailable here. As a result, the application may be rendered unusable in certain cases. Notably, the size of these assets, particularly the training model and certain components of ToothVision, surpasses 100 MB, leading to their restriction by Github. If you require access to our pre-trained datasets, please feel free to reach out to me.
